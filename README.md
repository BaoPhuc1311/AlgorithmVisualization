# Algorithm Visualization

## Introduction:
This project simplifies complex algorithms through interactive visualizations, making them easier for beginners to understand. The implemented algorithms include:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- (...)

The goal is to make learning algorithms more engaging through graphical representations.

## Objective:
- Visualize algorithms step by step.
- Allow users to control the execution (Start, Pause, Reset).
- Provide a user-friendly GUI with dark/light mode support.

## Requirement:
Python 3.x

## Installation
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/BaoPhuc1311/AlgorithmVisualization.git
cd AlgorithmVisualization
```

## Usage
Run the program using the following command:

```
python main.py
```
